# Vivek's Portfolio 

Welcome to my interactive portfolio, designed to look and feel like a modern, glass-morphism-style operating system. This project is a dynamic showcase of my skills in web development, built with a focus on a clean user interface, robust functionality, and a seamless user experience.

The entire portfolio is managed through a secure, integrated admin panel powered by Firebase, allowing for real-time content updates without touching the code.
